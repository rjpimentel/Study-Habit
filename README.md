# StudyHabit

This is an alarm application to help busy people find time to learn something new. In order to turn off an alarm, the application opens a series of flash cards. After filling in three correct cards, the alarm is deactivated. It serves a dual purpose: to wake you up by engaging your brain in the morning, as well as passively learn something new over time (such as US Capitals, spanish vocab, Bio terms, etc). StudyHabit integrates with Quizlet so you can search from billions of flashcards to add to your study set.
