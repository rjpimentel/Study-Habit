# StudyHabit

This is an alarm application to help busy people find time to learn something new. In order to turn off an alarm, the application opens a series of flash cards. After filling in three correct cards, the app brings you back to the homepage. StudyHabit integrates with Quizlet so you can search from billions of flashcards to add to your study set.
